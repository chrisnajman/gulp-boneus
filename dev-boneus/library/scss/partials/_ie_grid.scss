Stylesheet: IE Grid Styles

Since the example grid is based on media queries, so rather than
setup some js library that would make IE8 and below understand
media queries, let's just add some styles that serves a fixed grid.

Again, if you want to roll your own, just remove this junk and put
whatever you use in here.

Make sure that you prefix all styles with the relevant selector from 
the top of header.php, otherwise they will be exposed to ALL browsers! :

.lt-ie9 .mygridclass {}
.lt-ie8 .mygridclass {}
.lt-ie7 .mygridclass {}
